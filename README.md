### Introduction



Aromatic compounds represent the second most abundant organic class after carbohydrates, and the study of their microbial metabolism is relevant across several research fields. Numerous peripheral pathways converge on a small number of central intermediates that undergo aromatic ring-opening in the central pathways. This resource is designed to provide a useful and accessible platform for researchers worldwide, even those without specialized expertise in fungal aromatic catabolism, facilitating omics analysis and genomic comparisons.



### Pipeline summary



1. Run orthology analyis with [proteinortho](https://gitlab.com/paulklemm_PHD/proteinortho).
2. Run Rscript to generate tables and plots.



### Quick Start

1. Download fasta files to directory with FunMETAromaDB.faa file (rename extensiton of fasta to faa if needed)
2. Execute Proteinortho, comparing your .faa file(s) with the FunMETAromDB: 
```sh
proteinortho directory_fasta_files/*.faa -identity=40 -conn=0.3 -project=Results_FunMETAromaDB
```
3. Run the *FunMETAromaDB* script in your terminal or in [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download):
```sh
Rscript FunMETAroma.R
```
